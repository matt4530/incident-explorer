During this incident 100% of operations to forward ports and connect to a forwarded port failed for customers located in US West and Australia. The cause was due to a cross origin API change in our port forwarding service. After detecting the issue, we mitigated the impact by rolling back the change that caused the discrepancy in the cross origin rules. We have improved the way we are detecting issues like this one including implementing automated alerts during and after the rollout process so that we get signals as early as possible.",

This change was deployed to a subset of our global edge sites.The change had the unintended consequence of causing IPv4 addresses to start being passed as an IPv4-mapped IPv6-compatible address to our IP Allow List functionality.For example 10.1.2.3 became ::ffff:10.1.2.3. While our IP Allow List functionality was developed with IPv6 in mind, it wasn't developed to handle these mapped addresses, and hence started blocking requests as it deemed these to be not in the defined list of allowed addresses. Request error rates peaked at 0.23% of all requests.We have so far identified three remediation items here:- Update the IP Allow List functionality to handle IPv4-mapped addresses.- Audit the rest of our stack to confirm there are no further places this IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses flaw exists.- Improve our testing and monitoring processes to better catch these issues in the future.",

This led to a sustained period of timed out requests across a number of services, including but not limited to our git backend.  An average of 5% and max of 10% of requests failed with a 5xx response or timed out during this period.  This was caused by a combination of events that led to connection limits being hit in load balancer proxies in that site.  An upgrade of hosts was in flight, which meant a subset of proxy hosts were draining and coming offline as the upgrade rolled through the fleet.  A config change event also triggered a connection reset across all services in that site.  These events are commonplace, but led to a spike in connection establishment events that led to the online proxy hosts hitting the connection limit.  Upon further analysis, that limit was lower than it should have been.  We have increased that limit to prevent this from recurring.  We have also identified improvements to our monitoring of connection limits and behavior and changes to reduce the risk of proxy host upgrades leading to reduced capacity.",

Unfortunately, the outage prevented the generation of links for managing email subscriptions, resulting in the `/settings/emails` page timing out. Consequently, customers were unable to update their email subscription preferences during this period.During the incident we implemented graceful degradation on the `/settings/email` page to enable certain functionality, albeit with slower response times. By approximately 16:15 UTC on January 3rd, our contact permissions system was fully operational again, and customers could manage their email subscription preferences as usual.With the issue now resolved, our team is enhancing the `/settings/emails` page  resilience to minimize the impact of system outages in the future. This includes better request timeout handling and improved metrics and monitoring in this area of the application.",

The majority of impact was mitigated at 22:10, with a lower rate of failures ending by 22:50. This issue was caused by unhandled exceptions during routine maintenance of our internal networking hosts. Hosts that were thought to be no longer serving traffic were removed from service which led to the initial errors. Recovery took longer than expected because of issues in our automated recovery tooling. As a result, manual intervention was performed to remove the unhealthy hosts and requests returned to normal. The bug in the automated recovery tooling has been fixed and we’ve made changes to prevent unintended removal of hosts that are serving traffic.",

Delayed updates to Issues and Pull Requests were applied normally once the changes were rolled back. After the change was rolled back, a large queue of Actions-related jobs built up which included Pull Request, Pull Request review and Pull Request review comment events. About 2.3% of Actions jobs failed during the duration of the incident.

This delay affected various services utilizing background jobs, including Actions, Webhooks, Pull Requests, and Pages. The impact persisted for approximately one hour until 2:10 UTC.During the incident, some customers experienced delays in starting Github Actions workflow runs and Pages builds. We estimate that about 10% of Actions workflow runs were delayed during the impact window and 99% of Pages builds failed from 1:00 UTC to 1:20 UTC. Users may have experienced a delay in seeing recent pushes reflected in pull request views. This delay averaged between 5 and 10 minutes and affected up to 30% of pull request page views during the incident. 1% of pull request page views experienced delays of up to 60 minutes. Finally, 30% of webhook deliveries in this window missed our target of being delivered within 1 minute of the triggering event.This incident was caused by excessive rebalancing in our Kafka consumer group that feeds our background job system. We have altered our Kafka configuration to reduce the likelihood of this issue, created diagnostic tools to identify future causes, and will be breaking up this relay into multiple groups to limit the blast radius if the problem does reoccur.",

This resulted in a number of pages returning 404’s that should not have. Testing the build in our canary ring did not expose the service to sufficient traffic to discover the leak, allowing it to graduate to production at 6:37 PM UTC.  The memory leak under high load caused pods to crash repeatedly starting at 6:42 PM UTC, failing authorization checks. These failures triggered alerts at 6:44 PM UTC. Rolling back the authorization service change was delayed as parts of the deployment infrastructure relied on the authorization service and required manual intervention to complete. Rollback completed at 7:08 PM UTC and all impacted GitHub features recovered after pods came back online.  We are evaluating changes to our rollout strategy to better detect this sooner and with less impact, changes to remove the dependency between authorization services and deployment rollback, and incident response improvements to reduce the overall time to recover.This incident is unrelated to the Slack integration incident.  The combined status updates are a limitation of our status reporting tooling and we recognize the confusion this creates. Work to address this was already in progress and will be complete this month.",

Under normal operating conditions, a series of asynchronous jobs runs in response to every push and within a few seconds applies a number of side-effects in Pull Requests such as requesting reviews, marking Pull Requests as merged, and showing new commits. During the incident, jobs were entering the queue faster than we could process them, resulting in processing delays as high as 75 seconds on average, and as much as 15 minutes in the worst case. About 10% of all Pull Request page loads were showing out-of-date data during this time.We had recently created a dedicated worker pool for processing these side-effects, with the goal of improving isolation between services and providing product teams with more direct control over critical parts of the system. We mitigated the incident by increasing capacity of the worker pool, which fully processed the backlog of delayed jobs, and returned everything to normal by 16:07 UTC.

The root cause was identified to be a change that was deployed to an internal distributed event streaming platform which resulted in several worker nodes to go over a misconfigured memory limit. This caused these nodes to restart leading to a reduced job processing throughput. Github Actions relies on events delivered through this event streaming platform to start workflow runs and update their status. Delays in receiving these events led to run delays for about 40% of the Actions workflows.\tWe mitigated this through a rollback of the offending change at 00:18 UTC.

This capability is typically used for larger CI/CD systems and bulk download of repository data.  This also caused intermittent periods of Actions workflow failures.During this incident we saw bursts of increased unique traffic on specific endpoints that overloaded our caching capability for this system. In addition, the traffic caused saturation of the service that exposed a bug in downloading archived files at high load which caused some archives to be downloaded with incomplete data. This caused intermittent failure of workflows for GitHub Actions, which primarily downloads actions data via these endpoints.We mitigated this through improvements to our rate limiting and changes to get to a healthy state across our backend service and cache .

GitHub takes measures to ensure that we have redundancy in our system for various disaster scenarios. We have been working on building redundancy to an earlier single point of failure in our network architecture at a second Internet edge facility. This second Internet edge facility was completed in January and has been actively routing production traffic since then. Today we were performing a live failover test to validate that we could in fact use this second Internet edge facility if the primary were to fail. Unfortunately, during this failover we inadvertently caused a production outage.During the test we exposed that the secondary site had a network pathing configuration issue that prevented it from properly functioning as the primary facility. This caused issues with Internet connectivity to GitHub, ultimately resulting in an outage. We were immediately notified of the issue in our monitoring and alerting. Within two minutes of being alerted we reverted the change and brought the primary facility back online. Once online it took time for traffic to be rebalanced and for our border routers to reconverge restoring public connectivity to affected GitHub systems.This failover test helped expose the configuration issue, and we are addressing the gaps in both configuration and our failover testing which will help make GitHub more resilient. We recognize the severity of this outage and apologize for the impact it has to our customers.",
